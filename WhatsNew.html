                <h5 class="section-title">Important Updates to the Globee Awards Judging Process and Recognition</h5>
                <p>The Globee Awards is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity and transparency in
                    our judging process. We are also continually striving to enhance our recognition and rewards system
                    for both our esteemed judges and award winners. In line with these enhancements, we are implementing
                    several key updates, effective immediately:</p>

                <h5>1. Updates to Judge Profiles on the Globee Awards Website:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Profile Changes:</span> To respect the privacy and preferences of our
                        judges, individual profiles will no longer be published on the Globee Awards website.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Listing and LinkedIn Integration:</span> Instead, we will list the full
                        name of each judge on the relevant judges’ page. Accompanying each name will be a link to the
                        judge’s public LinkedIn profile, offering a comprehensive view of their professional credentials
                        and achievements.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Monthly Updates:</span> The judges’ page will now be updated at the end
                        of each month, reflecting the judges who have successfully completed their assignments in that
                        month. This change ensures timely and consolidated updates, rather than sporadic changes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2. Issuance of Certificates and eCertificate:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Recognition Timing:</span> To streamline our recognition process,
                        eBadges and eCertificates for our judges will be issued only after all winners of the Globee
                        Awards have been officially announced.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Enhanced Value:</span> This approach ensures that the recognition our
                        judges receive is aligned with the conclusion of the awards process, adding to the significance
                        of their contribution.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3. Digital Signature on Reference Letters:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Digital Efficiency:</span> As a step towards digital efficiency and
                        environmental responsibility, all reference letters will now be issued with digital signatures,
                        in accordance with our provided guidelines.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Sustainability and Security:</span> This move not only supports our
                        sustainability goals but also enhances the security and authenticity of the documents issued.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4. Recognition for Judges:</h5>
                <p>Judges who complete at least 50 assignments for any awards program will be honored with an eBadge and
                    an eCertificate specific to that program. Those who haven’t completed 50 assignments will receive a
                    special ‘Thank you’ mention on our judges’ page.</p>

                <h5>5. Participating Judges Acknowledgment:</h5>
                <p>Judges who have not completed at least 50 assignments for any awards program will not qualify for an
                    eBadge, an eCertificate specific to that program, or eligibility for a reference letter. However,
                    their contributions are still immensely appreciated, and to honor their participation, they will
                    receive a special mention on our judges’ page. This acknowledgment serves to express our
                    appreciation for their involvement and efforts, even if they did not meet the threshold for
                    receiving the digital recognitions or a reference letter. We deeply value all our judges for their
                    dedication and expertise, which play a crucial role in the success of the awards program.</p>

                <p>We believe these changes will streamline our processes and enhance the experience for our judges and
                    participants. Our goal is to maintain the prestige and fairness of the Globee Awards while adapting
                    to the evolving digital landscape and the preferences of our community.</p>
                <p>We thank all our judges and participants for their continued support and understanding as we
                    implement these updates.</p>

                <h5 class="section-title">Guidelines</h5>
                <ul class="guidelines-list">
                    <li><span class="highlight">Scoring:</span> Dedicate time to score each application on the new
                        data-driven scale.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Review and Submit:</span> After finishing an assignment, remember to

                <h5 class="section-title">Important Updates to the Globee Awards Judging Process and Recognition</h5>
                <p>The Globee Awards is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity and transparency in
                    our judging process. We are also continually striving to enhance our recognition and rewards system
                    for both our esteemed judges and award winners. In line with these enhancements, we are implementing
                    several key updates, effective immediately:</p>

                <h5>1. Updates to Judge Profiles on the Globee Awards Website:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Profile Changes:</span> To respect the privacy and preferences of our
                        judges, individual profiles will no longer be published on the Globee Awards website.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Listing and LinkedIn Integration:</span> Instead, we will list the full
                        name of each judge on the relevant judges’ page. Accompanying each name will be a link to the
                        judge’s public LinkedIn profile, offering a comprehensive view of their professional credentials
                        and achievements.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Monthly Updates:</span> The judges’ page will now be updated at the end
                        of each month, reflecting the judges who have successfully completed their assignments in that
                        month. This change ensures timely and consolidated updates, rather than sporadic changes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2. Issuance of Certificates and eCertificate:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Recognition Timing:</span> To streamline our recognition process,
                        eBadges and eCertificates for our judges will be issued only after all winners of the Globee
                        Awards have been officially announced.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Enhanced Value:</span> This approach ensures that the recognition our
                        judges receive is aligned with the conclusion of the awards process, adding to the significance
                        of their contribution.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3. Digital Signature on Reference Letters:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Digital Efficiency:</span> As a step towards digital efficiency and
                        environmental responsibility, all reference letters will now be issued with digital signatures,
                        in accordance with our provided guidelines.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Sustainability and Security:</span> This move not only supports our
                        sustainability goals but also enhances the security and authenticity of the documents issued.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4. Recognition for Judges:</h5>
                <p>Judges who complete at least 50 assignments for any awards program will be honored with an eBadge and
                    an eCertificate specific to that program. Those who haven’t completed 50 assignments will receive a
                    special ‘Thank you’ mention on our judges’ page.</p>

                <h5>5. Participating Judges Acknowledgment:</h5>
                <p>Judges who have not completed at least 50 assignments for any awards program will not qualify for an
                    eBadge, an eCertificate specific to that program, or eligibility for a reference letter. However,
                    their contributions are still immensely appreciated, and to honor their participation, they will
                    receive a special mention on our judges’ page. This acknowledgment serves to express our
                    appreciation for their involvement and efforts, even if they did not meet the threshold for
                    receiving the digital recognitions or a reference letter. We deeply value all our judges for their
                    dedication and expertise, which play a crucial role in the success of the awards program.</p>

                <p>We believe these changes will streamline our processes and enhance the experience for our judges and
                    participants. Our goal is to maintain the prestige and fairness of the Globee Awards while adapting
                    to the evolving digital landscape and the preferences of our community.</p>
                <p>We thank all our judges and participants for their continued support and understanding as we
                    implement these updates.</p>
